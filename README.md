[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs/releases).


Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "efs" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs.git?ref=master"

  namespace          = "eg"
  stage              = "test"
  name               = "app"
  region             = "us-west-1"
  vpc_id             = var.vpc_id
  subnets            = var.private_subnets
  security_groups    = [var.security_group_id]
  zone_id            = var.aws_route53_dns_zone_id
}
```
